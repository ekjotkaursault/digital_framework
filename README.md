This is fully responsive web page with pause and resume buttons and 4 images that are being displayed on a rotating cycle and changes after 10 seconds, which works very smoothly.

------------------------------------------

**Code Attribution**
This project was designed and developed by me (Ekjot Kaur) as part of my exploration of Flutterâ€™s web development capabilities.
While the overall structure, logic, and design are original, I referenced a few official and educational resources to understand:

Timer-based image rotation in Flutter

Handling state in StatefulWidget

Connecting AWS S3 images

Responsive layout techniques in Flutter

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**External Resources Used** 
that were used for my learning:


**Flutter Image Widget Documentation** https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Image-class.html 

Helped me display online images using Image.network() from AWS S3.

**Flutter Timer Class**  https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Timer-class.html

Guided the implementation of automatic image transitions every 10 seconds using Timer.periodic().

**Flutter Layout and Responsiveness Guides**  https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout

Provided best practices for building responsive UI using MediaQuery, Expanded, and Flexible widgets.

**AWS S3 Documentation**  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html

Used to upload images to the cloud and retrieve their public URLs.

**Flutter Web Deployment Guide** https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web

Helped me deploy the project to GitHub Pages after building it for web.

**My Original Work Includes:**

1. App concept, design, and structure

2. Integration of AWS S3 images into the Flutter app

3. Timer logic for 10-second image transitions

4. Pause and Resume button logic

5. Custom responsive layout for web and mobile

6. GitHub Pages deployment setup

7. Full documentation including README, folder structure, and run instructions
